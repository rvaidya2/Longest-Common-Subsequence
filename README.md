# Longest-Common-Subsequence

Given two strings, S1 and S2, the task is to find the length of the Longest Common Subsequence, i.e. longest subsequence present in both of the strings. 

A longest common subsequence (LCS) is defined as the longest subsequence which is common in all given input sequences.
